Hey hey 

This is my 1st custom build skin, I'm very new to this ~ 
So, please if you have nice some tips would like to share that's would be grateful~


Here's project basic outline

Base on the existing "skin.Aeon.Nox-SiLVO (6.0.5 Krypton)"
I am trying to transform to "minic" or "rapic" skin type
(both are quiet good, for the details)


The original Aeon.Nox-SiLVO(6.0.5 Krypton)package was post on Taiwan Forume webite:
https://www.mobile01.com/topicdetail.php?f=347&t=5046928&p=1

It is an fully functional buildup for android system,
At this stage only working within MacOSX, untill I can figure out how to setup
"Andriod-Studio" properly (it's a huge mission to learn)

Anyway, it's not like others that I have a genius-technical brain!
Please consider me as a "Kindergarten: levelish new student~ 

Thank you guys
